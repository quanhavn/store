# Create a New Beads Issue

Help me create a well-structured issue for this project.

Ask me for:
1. **Title**: A short, descriptive title
2. **Description**: What needs to be done (I'll provide details)
3. **Priority**: low, medium, high, critical (default: medium)
4. **Type**: feature, bug, chore, docs (default: feature)

Then create the issue with:
```bash
bd create "<title>" --description "<description>" --priority <priority> --type <type>
```

After creating, show me the issue with `bd show <issue-id>` to confirm it was created correctly.
